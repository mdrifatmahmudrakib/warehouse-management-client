He’s Such an asset to The warehouse.</p>

Beneath its thin exterior is a powerful PC with ample data storage and a battery that lasts the entire day of non-stop use. I'm very happy with this purchase.</p>

The screen is vivid and great for graphics. The speakers are not as good as on my last computer, but I purchased a headset to compensate. I don't use the touch screen, and I really haven't tested the battery life, yet.</p>
